# Bowling Events Results Manager ðŸŽ³

This repository contains the logic, automation, and UI integration for managing  **bowling event results** .

It bridges the gap between **Google Sheets** (where organizers input scores) and a **web-based results page** (where players and visitors view results).

The goal is to make the process **simple for organizers** with no technical background, while providing a **polished, real-time experience** for end users.

---

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. **Score Input (Non-technical users):**
   * Organizers update results directly in **Google Sheets** .
   * No coding, no setup â€” just entering scores like a normal spreadsheet.
2. **Backend Logic (This repository):**
   * Fetches and processes scores from Google Sheets.
   * Applies business rules: standings, totals, pairs/ternas, and tie-break logic.
   * Prepares clean, structured data for the front-end.
3. **Frontend UI:**
   * Displays results in a **user-friendly webpage** .
   * Data updates automatically whenever the sheet changes.
